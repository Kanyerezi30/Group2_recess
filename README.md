INTRODUCTION
 Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a gram-negative bacterium which is associated with a high burden of infections and antimicrobial resistance in humans, and contamination in food production systems worldwide [1, 2]. In Uganda, E. coli is the predominant pathogen causing urinary tract infections diagnosed at all levels of care and is associated with increasing levels of resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics [3]. 

E. coli is commensal of the mammalian gastro-intestinal tract. This attribute combined with its generally poor survival in the external environment, has led to its use as an indicator of recent faecal contamination and therefore of the potential occurrence of enteric pathogens [4]. This is important for assessment of the quality of water used in communities. WHO states that there should be no detectable E. coli in any 100 ml samples of water directly intended for drinking [5]. 

Studies conducting molecular characterization of E. coli to elucidate its epidemiology and evolution of antimicrobial resistance have shown that E. coli exhibits large genotypic and phenotypic diversity across strains. More than 50 different resistance determinants, including acquired resistance genes and chromosomal resistance mutations have been detected [6,7]. However, there is limited information on the genetic background of E. coli sampled from the environment, especially in Africa due to few genetic studies on non-clinical bacteria in general. 

E. coli isolated from rural drinking water systems and household storage in Kenya were whole genome sequenced to characterize each isolate [8]. We used the raw sequence data to assemble the sequences, to re-generate the genomes of the isolates, identify the pan-genome and determine the phylogenetic grouping, multi-locus sequence types (MLSTs and Clermontyping) of the isolates. This was done to investigate the diversity of phylogroups, multi-locus sequence types, and virulence and antibiotic resistance genes within and between water supplies and household water storage. 

Objectives 
The objectives of the analysis were:

•	To determine the extent to which E. coli in the distribution system is linked to either human or livestock faecal contamination.
•	To determine the health risk implications of changes in E. coli concentration between point of collection (PoC) and point of use (PoU).
